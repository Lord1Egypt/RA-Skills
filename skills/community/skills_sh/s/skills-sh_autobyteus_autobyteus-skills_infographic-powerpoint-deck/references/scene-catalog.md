# Scene catalog (IDs + tags)

Use scene IDs in `slides_visual_plan.md` so scene selection is explicit and reusable.
Scene IDs are shorthand only. The final prompt should translate the chosen ID into plain location, material, contrast, and text-zone instructions.

## Selection rule

- Pick one primary scene ID per slide.
- For dense text slides, prefer lower-noise IDs (e.g., `sunlit-library-day`, `atrium-morning`, `scribe-desk-candle`).
- For `L9`, `L10`, or `L11`, usually prefer board-oriented IDs such as `didactic-board-bright`, `mirrored-comparison-board`, `concept-board-neutral`, or `catalog-grid-clean`. If the chosen style pack is `illustrative-cinematic`, a calm architectural or symbolic scene ID can also work when it still preserves clear board structure and readable teaching modules.
- For warning/climax slides, use higher-tension IDs sparingly.
- Use scene tags to match style packs:
  - `editorial-light`/`airy-relaxed`: `daylight`, `clean`, `calm`, `open-space`
  - `warm-sermon`: `warm`, `pastoral`, `devotional`
  - `neo-tech`: `tech`, `data`, `network`, `startup`
  - `youth-social`: `youth`, `social`, `vibrant`
  - `research-academic`: `academic`, `neutral`, `structured`, `evidence`
  - `whiteboard-sketch`: `bright`, `sketch`, `diagram`, `teaching`
  - `illustrative-cinematic`: `illustrative`, `cinematic`, `daylight`, `architectural`, `teaching`
