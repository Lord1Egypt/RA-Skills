# dia-ask — drive Dia's assistant from the CLI

Delegate a prompt to the AI assistant inside a locally-running [Dia](https://www.diabrowser.com/) browser and read its answer as a file. Dia renders logged-in, JavaScript-heavy pages in your real session and writes its answer to disk, so you get exact text — any length, any format — without screen OCR.

**Dia is eyes, not hands:** reach for it to *read / research* what's behind a login or heavy JS; use other tools to *act* (click, submit).

## Requirements

- macOS, with **Dia installed** (runs on your own Dia + subscription — no hosted service).
- **Accessibility permission** for the process running `node` (System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility).
- Node.js ≥ 18. No dependencies.

## Usage

```
node dia-ask-v2.js "<prompt>" [--format md|txt|json|csv] [--timeout 300] [--no-fallback] [--debug]
```

Prints **one line** to stdout: the absolute path of the file Dia wrote. Read that file.

```bash
node dia-ask-v2.js "summarize the open tab and list every external link" --format md
node dia-ask-v2.js "extract every row of the pricing table on the page" --format csv --timeout 600
```

- `dia-ask-v2.js` — default, **focus-safe** (injects into Dia's existing window via `CGEventPostToPid`; never steals focus).
- `dia-ask.js` — v1 fallback (opens a fresh window, briefly takes focus). v2 falls back to it automatically; `--no-fallback` disables.

## Caveats

Unofficial UI automation: it depends on Dia's window/Accessibility internals and can break on any Dia update. No official API. macOS only. A reference implementation, not a hardened product. See `README.md`.
