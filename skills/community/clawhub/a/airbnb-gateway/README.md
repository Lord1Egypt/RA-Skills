# airbnb-gateway

A reusable OpenClaw / Codex-style **skill package** for safe, coherent,
end-to-end Airbnb host operations: inbox checks, thread reading, reservation
lookup, booking summaries, calendar inspection, draft replies, **verified**
message sending, and disciplined escalation.

It does not add transport. It orchestrates whatever Airbnb tooling your
environment already has — first-class Airbnb endpoints, agent-browser, DevTools,
Playwright — behind one consistent operating model so multiple agents behave
identically and never duplicate a guest message.

## Why this exists

Two reliability lessons are baked into the design:

1. **Browser weirdness ≠ Airbnb down.** Auth is host-owned; prefer platform-aware
   endpoints before generic browser automation.
2. **`sent: true` ≠ delivered.** A send is only `confirmed` after re-reading the
   live thread and *seeing* the message. Endpoint success is just `attempted`,
   and an `unconfirmed` send is **never** auto-resent.

## Install / use

1. Drop `skills/airbnb-gateway/` into your skills library.
2. Edit **`references/airbnb-tool-priority.md`** — map the abstract tool roles to
   the real tool names in your deployment. This is the only required
   customization.
3. (Optional) Set your approval policy and wire a persistent send ledger.
4. Point your agents at the skill. They should speak only in the command verbs
   (`check_inbox`, `read_thread`, `send_reply`, …) and never call low-level
   Airbnb tools directly.

## What's portable vs. deployment-specific

| Portable (don't fork) | Deployment-specific (customize) |
|---|---|
| The Five Laws | role → tool name map |
| Send state machine | approval policy |
| Safety tiers (READ/WRITE/MUTATE) | persistent ledger wiring |
| Command vocabulary | example payload shapes |

## Status

v0.1.0 — read operations + verified single-send. Calendar/pricing/listing
mutations are intentionally **out of scope** until v2 (refuse + escalate).

## License

MIT. No private tokens, paths, or secrets are embedded — example tool names are
illustrative and must be mapped to your environment.
