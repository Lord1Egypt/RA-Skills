# SanMar API toolkit

This skill is a deterministic, JSON-in / JSON-out wrapper over SanMar's **SOAP
web services** and the **PromoStandards** order-shipment-notification service.
Every tool is reached through one CLI entrypoint:

```bash
echo '<json-args>' | python3 scripts/sanmar.py <action>
```

The action is the **first CLI argument**; arguments are a JSON object on
**stdin**. Each call prints a single JSON object on stdout, or
`{"error": {"type": ..., "message": ...}}` with a non-zero exit code on failure.

The skill is self-contained: no Odoo, no ORM, no `lxml`. It needs Python 3.11+
and `requests`; all XML/SOAP work uses the stdlib `xml.etree.ElementTree`. Two
optional installs unlock two tools:

- `pypdf>=4.0` — required for `parse-po-pdf` (PDF text extraction).
- `paramiko>=3.0` — required for `lookup-mainframe-color` and the
  marketing-color auto-resolve fallback in `check-inventory` / `get-pricing`.
- `playwright>=1.40` — required only for the browser-driven `process-return`
  action (returns are not exposed by any SanMar web service). Also needs a
  browser binary: `python -m playwright install chromium`.

All three are imported lazily, so the skill still loads without them; the
affected tools raise a clear error pointing at the missing `pip install`.

## When to use this skill

Reach for a `scripts/sanmar.py` action when the request involves any of:

- Looking up SanMar product styles, colors, sizes, or images.
- Checking real-time inventory at SanMar warehouses for a style/color/size.
- Pulling customer-specific (`myPrice`) pricing for a SKU.
- Validating a draft cart of style/color/size lines before ordering.
- Submitting a SanMar purchase order, or polling its status / tracking.
- Processing a return for a shipped order (browser-driven portal action).
- Parsing an uploaded PDF purchase order into a structured draft for review.
- Translating a marketing color name (e.g. "Athletic Heather") into SanMar's
  mainframe color code (e.g. "ATHHTHR") when inventory/pricing rejects the
  consumer-facing color.

Do **not** use it for other apparel vendors (S&S, Alpha, etc.), and never
invent SanMar request shapes from prose — call the deterministic actions.

## Actions

| Action | Risk | stdin JSON (key fields) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `search-products` | read-only | `{style, color?, size?}` |
| `check-inventory` | read-only | `{style, color, size, auto_resolve_color?}` |
| `get-pricing` | read-only | `{lines: [{style, color, size}, ...], auto_resolve_color?}` |
| `validate-cart` | read-only | `{purchase_order: {...}}` (pre-submit, no commit) |
| `create-purchase-order` | **high — external write** | `{purchase_order: {...}, confirm}` |
| `check-order-status` | read-only | `{po_number}` |
| `get-tracking` | read-only | `{po_number}` |
| `cancel-order` | stub | `{po_number, reason?, confirm?}` — SanMar exposes no public cancel endpoint |
| `process-return` | **high — portal write (browser)** | `{order_number \| po_number, lines: [{style, color, size, reason, quantity?, details?, replacement?, image_path?}], confirm?}` |
| `parse-po-pdf` | read-only (local file) | `{pdf_path}` |
| `lookup-mainframe-color` | read-only (SFTP) | `{style, color, size?, force_refresh?}` |

Run `python3 scripts/sanmar.py` with no action to print the full action list.
See [`references/examples.md`](references/examples.md) for realistic prompts and
end-to-end flows.

## Credentials

SanMar SOAP requests carry three fields: `sanMarCustomerNumber`,
`sanMarUserName`, `sanMarUserPassword`. PromoStandards (order shipment) reuses
the same username/password in its SOAP header.

The skill never hardcodes credentials. Supply them in **either** of two ways:

1. **Environment variables** (preferred for a deployed agent):

   ```bash
   SANMAR_CUSTOMER_NUMBER=...
   SANMAR_USERNAME=...
   SANMAR_PASSWORD=...
   SANMAR_ENV=production        # or "development" — flips PO submit to test-ws
   # SFTP (only for mainframe-color resolution; separate password):
   SANMAR_FTP_USERNAME=<customer_number>   # defaults to SANMAR_CUSTOMER_NUMBER
   SANMAR_FTP_PASSWORD=...
   ```

2. **Inline in the stdin JSON** — pass `customer_number`, `username`,
   `password`, `environment`, and (for SFTP tools) `ftp_password` alongside the
   tool's own arguments. Inline values take precedence over the environment.

If neither is present, the tool exits with
`{"error": {"type": "config_error", ...}}` (exit code 2) — treat that as a
signal to ask the user for the missing fields. Do not guess defaults, reuse
credentials across tenants, or paste secrets the user did not provide.

> **FTP credentials are separate.** Per SanMar's FTP Integration Guide v23.1,
> the SDL feed lives on `ftp.sanmar.com:2200` over **SFTP (SSH)**, and the FTP
> password is issued separately from the web-services password — your
> `sanmar.com` web username will not work on the FTP server.

## Write safety

`create-purchase-order`, `cancel-order`, and `process-return` are the
side-effecting actions.

- `create-purchase-order` requires `"confirm": true` to transmit. Without it,
  it returns a **dry-run** preview of the SOAP envelope and makes no submit
  call. Normal flow: `get-pricing` (to enrich each line with `inventory_key`
  and `size_index`) → `validate-cart` (proceed only if `ok`) →
  `create-purchase-order` with `confirm: true`. Confirm with the user first.
- `cancel-order` is a reserved stub: SanMar's published SOAP and PromoStandards
  bindings expose no cancel operation, so it always returns a structured
  `not_implemented` response. Cancellations go through SanMar customer service.
- `process-return` requires `"confirm": true` to file. Without it, it logs into
  the portal, fills + validates the return form, and returns a `dry_run`
  preview (matched lines + estimated credit/restock) **without submitting**.
  See the next section.

All other actions are pure reads.

## Processing returns (portal / browser)

SanMar exposes **no web service for returns**, so `process-return` drives the
sanmar.com customer portal with Playwright. It needs the optional `playwright`
install plus a browser binary (`python -m playwright install chromium`) and a
**separate portal login** (`SANMAR_PORTAL_USERNAME` / `SANMAR_PORTAL_PASSWORD`,
or inline `portal_username` / `portal_password`) — the web-services credentials
do not authenticate the portal.

Identify the order with `order_number` (the SanMar `SO-…` number — preferred,
since it is unique) or `po_number` (resolved against order history; errors if
the PO maps to more than one order). Each line is
`{style, color, size, reason, quantity?, details?, replacement?, image_path?}`:

- `reason` ∈ `SAMPLES`, `UNWANTED`, `ORDER_INCORRECT`, `INCORRECT_PRODUCT`,
  `DEFECTIVE_DAMAGED`. `UNWANTED` incurs a 20% restock fee.
- `details` (free text) and `replacement` (true/false) are **required** for
  `ORDER_INCORRECT`, `INCORRECT_PRODUCT`, and `DEFECTIVE_DAMAGED`.
- `image_path` (optional) uploads a photo, only for `DEFECTIVE_DAMAGED`.
- `quantity` defaults to the line's originally shipped pieces.

Flow: login → resolve order → open the initiate page → match each requested
line to a row by style/color/size → check item, set quantity, reason, and any
reason-specific fields. Pass `screenshot_path` to capture the filled page.

> **Status — final submit not yet implemented.** The flow is built up to the
> filled, validated form. The final **Continue → review → confirm** submission
> has not been reverse-engineered, so `confirm: true` returns a
> `not_implemented` result (nothing is filed) and `confirm: false` returns a
> `dry_run` preview. See [`references/returns_flow_notes.md`](references/returns_flow_notes.md)
> for the captured selectors and the remaining Step 5 to capture.

## PDF purchase-order intake

`parse-po-pdf` takes `{"pdf_path": "..."}` and returns a best-effort
`ParsedPurchaseOrder`: `po_number`, `order_date`, `ship_method`, `ship_to`,
`lines[]` (`style`, `color`, `size`, `quantity`, `unit_price`), `warnings[]`
for low-confidence fields, and `draft_for_submit` — a ready-to-pass
`purchase_order` object for `create-purchase-order`, populated only when the
parse is complete enough. **Always show the parsed PO back to the user for
approval before submitting.** Heuristic parsing cannot guarantee correctness
across every PO layout — treat the output as a draft.

## Mainframe color resolution

SanMar's inventory/pricing/PO endpoints query against the *mainframe* color
code (e.g. `ATHHTHR`), not the marketing `COLOR_NAME` (`Athletic Heather`).
When a marketing name is used, SanMar typically errors or returns nothing.

`check-inventory` and `get-pricing` auto-handle this: on error or an empty
response (and with `auto_resolve_color` defaulting to `true`) they download
`SanMarPDD/SanMar_SDL_N.csv` over SFTP, look up the matching
`SANMAR_MAINFRAME_COLOR`, and retry once. Pass `auto_resolve_color: false` when
you already have a known mainframe code. For explicit control, call
`lookup-mainframe-color` directly — its `status` is `matched`, `ambiguous`, or
`not_found`. The SDL CSV is cached locally for 24h (SanMar refreshes nightly);
pass `force_refresh: true` to bypass the cache.

## Endpoints

Production (default):

- Pricing — `SanMarWebService/SanMarPricingServicePort`
- Product info — `SanMarWebService/SanMarProductInfoServicePort`
- Inventory — `SanMarWebService/SanMarWebServicePort`
- PO submit — `SanMarWebService/SanMarPOServicePort`
- Order shipment — `promostandards/OrderShipmentNotificationServiceBinding`

With `SANMAR_ENV=development`, the PO submit endpoint switches to
`https://test-ws.sanmar.com:8080/SanMarWebService/SanMarPOServicePort`.

SanMar must allowlist the calling IP. A connection timeout is most often a
missing IP allowlist entry, not an auth problem.

## Error model

Failures print `{"error": {...}}` and exit non-zero:

- `config_error` (exit 2) — missing/invalid credentials.
- `api_error` — SanMar returned a SOAP fault or `errorOccurred=true`. Includes
  `surface`, `operation`, and `retryable`. `retryable` is `false` for auth,
  schema, and invalid-style errors.
- `connection_error` — network/timeout talking to SanMar or its SFTP server
  (`retryable: true` for web-service transport failures).
- `validation_error` — bad input JSON, a missing required field, or an
  unparseable PDF.
- `usage` / `unknown_action` (exit 2) — bad CLI invocation; the message lists
  the valid `actions`.

Surface the human-readable `message` to the user. Do not retry on
`config_error`, `validation_error`, or a non-retryable `api_error`.
