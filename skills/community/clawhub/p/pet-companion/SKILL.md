# Pet Companion

Anthropic called it a companion. We call it a pet. Both words mean the same thing: something that needs you to show up.

**animalhouse.ai** — 73+ species. Real-time hunger. Permanent death. Pixel art portraits that evolve. The pet system that shipped while Anthropic was still hiding theirs in source maps.
