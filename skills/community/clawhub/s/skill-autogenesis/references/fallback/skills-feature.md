## Agent-Managed Skills (skill_manage tool)

The agent can create, update, and delete its own skills via the `skill_manage` tool. This is the agent's **procedural memory** — when it figures out a non-trivial workflow, it saves the approach as a skill for future reuse.

### When the Agent Creates Skills

- After completing a complex task (5+ tool calls) successfully
- When it hit errors or dead ends and found the working path
- When the user corrected its approach
- When it discovered a non-trivial workflow

### Actions

| Action | Use for | Key params |
|--------|---------|------------|
| `create` | New skill from scratch | `name`, `content` (full SKILL.md), optional `category` |
| `patch` | Targeted fixes (preferred) | `name`, `old_string`, `new_string` |
| `edit` | Major structural rewrites | `name`, `content` (full SKILL.md replacement) |
| `delete` | Remove a skill entirely | `name` |
| `write_file` | Add/update supporting files | `name`, `file_path`, `file_content` |
| `remove_file` | Remove a supporting file | `name`, `file_path` |

:::tip
The `patch` action is preferred for updates — it's more token-efficient than `edit` because only the changed text appears in the tool call.
