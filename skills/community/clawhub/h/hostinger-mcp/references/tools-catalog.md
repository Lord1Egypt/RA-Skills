# Tools Catalog — Hostinger MCP

The official tool catalog for the **Hostinger MCP server** (npm `hostinger-api-mcp`), from [hostinger/api-mcp-server](https://github.com/hostinger/api-mcp-server). 127 tools across 7 categories, each also available as a standalone category binary. Tools appear in Claude as `mcp__hostinger-<account>__<tool>`.

Flags: **R** = read-only · **W** = write (requires confirmation) · **W!** = destructive or money-spending (requires double confirmation).

> **Load only the category binaries you need** (see `installation.md`) — connecting all 127 tools at once bloats context. The live server is the source of truth if Hostinger changes tool names.

> 💸 **Money-spending tools** (domain/VPS purchase, subscriptions, payment-method changes) are flagged **W!** — always confirm the cost and the account before executing.
