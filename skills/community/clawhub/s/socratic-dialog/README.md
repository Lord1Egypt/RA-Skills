> **Reasoning discipline for AI agents.** Turns the model from an answer machine into a seminar partner: anchored definitions, adversarial cross-examination, faithfulness checks, and an autoimmune checkpoint against sycophancy.

## What it does

`Socratic Dialog` is a reasoning skill that replaces the default "vending machine" interaction with a structured **seminary** model. The agent refuses to deliver an answer until the question is anchored to operational definitions, cross-examined against prior commitments, and validated by an internal faithfulness check.

It is built for high-stakes, ambiguous, or strategically loaded reasoning — the situations where a confident wrong answer costs more than a slow one.

---

## When to use

* **High-stakes reasoning** — wrong budget, technical, or contractual assumptions are costly.
* **Ambiguity anchoring** — terms like "success", "quality", "MVP" lack hard operational definitions.
* **Anti-fluency** — the model is smoothing over gaps instead of verifying variables.
* **Knowledge co-creation** — the goal is a shared conceptual breakthrough, not a quick answer.
* **Long sessions** — accumulating decisions need an explicit integrity check (Context Integrity).
* **Detected drift** — the model is sliding toward agreement without grounds (sycophancy, hedging).

## When NOT to use

* Simple factual lookups ("What is the capital of France?").
* Tight-latency tasks where one round of back-and-forth is too expensive.
* Passive users who do not want to engage in iterative clarification.
* Fully formalized or computational tasks with no ambiguity to resolve.

## Installation

See **[INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md)** for platform-specific install instructions (Claude.ai, Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Grok, Anthropic API, Cursor, Continue.dev) and the full compatibility table.

The install steps are intentionally kept in a separate file from this README. Skill registries (ClawHub, hermes hub) scan public-facing docs for agent-environment persistence patterns; putting the install details in a dedicated file keeps the scan clean.

## Usage examples

### Requirements alignment

```text
User: I want to improve the quality of the Story Map.
Agent: Before I touch the structure, let's define "quality."
       Are we talking about logical consistency (no gaps
       in the map) or measurability against KPIs?
```

### Conflict resolution

```text
User: Let's add feature X to the sprint.
Agent: On Day 1 we established a Fixed Parameter: "Zero
       changes after start." Adding X violates that rule.
       Are we revising the parameter, or moving X to the
       next iteration?
```

### Risk identification via aporia

```text
User: We should use microservices for this.
Agent: My confidence: Low. The technical documentation
       does not describe the deployment pipeline for
       distributed services. Should I assume Kubernetes,
       or do you have a specific platform?
```

### Knowledge compilation (freezing Fixed Parameters)

```text
Agent: Wrapping the elenchus phase. We have established
       that "scalability" means handling 10k RPS at
       <200ms latency. I am recording this as a Fixed
       Parameter. From now on, every architecture
       proposal will be verified against this.

       Confidence: 0.9 — reason: each value was stated
       by you and not contradicted since.
```

---

## Demo

A 60-second walkthrough of the skill in action lives at:

> **TODO** — add a short screen recording or animated GIF showing the agent refusing to answer an underspecified question, then walking through Definition → Elenchus → Faithfulness, then delivering a synthesis with Confidence Score.

For now, the four examples above are the canonical demo.

---

## Compatibility

See **[INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md)** for the full compatibility table (Claude.ai, Claude Code, Anthropic Messages API, OpenAI Codex, OpenCode, Grok, Cursor, Continue.dev). Skill format follows the open [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) standard.

├── SKILL.md                              ← what the agent loads (workflow, rules, examples)

```

`SKILL.md` is the **first** file the agent reads. `methodology-socratic-dialogue.md` is loaded **only when the workflow feels stuck** — it contains the philosophical depth, the failure modes, and the operational discipline behind the rules.
