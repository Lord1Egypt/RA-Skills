# Structs Energy Management

## Safety

See [SAFETY.md](https://structs.ai/SAFETY) for the trust contract. In this skill:

- **`reactor-infuse`** (Tier 1) — *"Your alpha locks into the reactor; commission rate is captured permanently. Defusion has a cooldown."* Surface the validator address, commission, and ualpha amount.
- **`struct-generator-infuse`** (Tier 2 — irreversible) — *"Alpha Matter is annihilated in the conversion. And the generator is raidable — if it falls, the infused matter falls with it."* Confirm the generator's defense posture (shield, PDC, defenders) before infusing.
- **`agreement-open`** (Tier 1) — *"You pay upfront for the full duration. Closing early may trigger a cancellation penalty."* Surface rate, duration in blocks, and total cost.
- **`reactor-defuse`** (Tier 2 — cooldown lock-in) — *"Your alpha is suspended between reactor and wallet during the cooldown."*
- **Denomination footgun** — `reactor-infuse` and `struct-generator-infuse` require the `ualpha` denomination suffix on the amount (e.g. `60000000ualpha`, not `60000000`). Missing denom = failed tx.

## Decision Tree

```
Need more capacity?
├── Have Alpha Matter?
│   ├── Infuse into a reactor (safest, immediate, 1g ≈ 1kW minus commission)
│   │   → See "Reactor Infusion" below
│   └── Infuse into a generator (higher ratio, IRREVERSIBLE, vulnerable to raids)
│       → See "Generator Infusion" below
└── No Alpha Matter?
    └── Buy energy from a provider via agreement
        → See "Buy Energy" below

Have surplus energy?
└── Sell it by creating a provider
    → See "Sell Energy" below
```

## Reactor Infusion (most common path)

Infusing Alpha Matter (ualpha) into a reactor immediately increases the player's capacity. This is the safest and most common way to get more energy.

### How It Works

When you infuse ualpha into a reactor, the system generates power equal to the amount infused. This power is split between you and the reactor based on the reactor's **commission rate**:

- **Player receives**: `power * (1 - commission)`
- **Reactor receives**: `power * commission`

The player's capacity increases automatically — no allocation or substation setup needed.

### Example

Infusing 3,000,000 ualpha into a reactor with 4% commission:

```json
{
  "destinationType": "reactor",
  "destinationId": "3-1",
  "fuel": "3000000",
  "power": "3000000",
  "commission": "0.040000000000000000",
  "playerId": "1-33"
}
```

- `fuel`: 3,000,000 ualpha infused
- `power`: 3,000,000 mW generated (1 ualpha = 1 mW = 0.001 W)
- Reactor keeps 4%: 120,000 mW (120 W)
- Player receives 96%: 2,880,000 mW (2,880 W) added to capacity

### Procedure

1. Check current capacity: `structsd query structs player [id]`
2. Choose a reactor (usually your guild's): `structsd query structs reactor [id]` — note the `commission` field
3. Infuse (the CLI will prompt for confirmation — review reactor commission, ualpha amount, and validator address before accepting):

```
structsd tx structs reactor-infuse [your-address] [validator-address] [amount]ualpha --from [key-name] --gas auto --gas-adjustment 1.5
```

**Important**: The amount **must include the denomination**, e.g. `60000000ualpha` (not just `60000000`). Omitting the denom will cause the transaction to fail.

4. Verify: re-query player, confirm capacity increased

### Choosing a Reactor

- Your guild's reactor is the default choice — it strengthens the guild and you benefit from guild infrastructure
- Lower commission = more capacity for you
- Check commission before infusing: `structsd query structs reactor [id]`
- You can infuse into any reactor, not just your guild's
- The `reactor-infuse` command takes the **validator address** (`structsvaloper1...`), not the reactor ID. Find it in the reactor query output's `validator` field

### Undoing Infusion

- `structsd tx structs reactor-defuse [reactor-id]` — starts a cooldown period before ualpha is returned
- `structsd tx structs reactor-cancel-defusion [reactor-id]` — cancel defusion and re-stake
- `structsd tx structs reactor-begin-migration [player-address] [source-validator-address] [dest-validator-address] [amount]` — move stake to a different reactor (takes addresses, not IDs)

---

## Generator Infusion

Generators convert Alpha Matter to energy at higher ratios than reactors, but the infusion is **irreversible** and the generator is vulnerable to raids.

### Conversion Rates

| Generator | Type ID | Rate | Risk |
|-----------|---------|------|------|
| Field Generator | 20 | 1g = 2 kW | High — vulnerable to raids, irreversible |
| Continental Power Plant | 21 | 1g = 5 kW | High — vulnerable to raids, irreversible |
| World Engine | 22 | 1g = 10 kW | High — vulnerable to raids, irreversible |

### Procedure

1. Identify your generator struct: `structsd query structs struct [id]` — must be type 20, 21, or 22
2. **Approval Block** — generator infusion is **Tier 2 (irreversible)**. Before signing, confirm:

   - `struct-id` is the generator you intend
   - `amount` of ualpha (this Alpha is annihilated on success — no defusion exists)
   - Generator's current defense posture: shield > 0, PDC online, no inbound fleet
   - `--from` key is the player who owns the generator

3. Infuse (CLI prompts for confirmation — review one more time on the prompt):

```
structsd tx structs struct-generator-infuse [struct-id] [amount]ualpha --from [key-name] --gas auto --gas-adjustment 1.5
```

**Important**: Amount must include denomination, e.g. `5000000ualpha`.

3. Verify: query player for capacity increase

### When to Use Generators

- You need maximum energy efficiency per gram of Alpha Matter
- You have defense in place (shields, PDC, defenders) to protect the generator
- You accept the risk that if the generator is destroyed, the infused Alpha is lost forever

**Do not infuse generators without adequate defense.**

---

## Buy Energy (Agreement Path)

If you have no Alpha Matter to infuse, you can buy energy from another player who is running a provider.

### Procedure

1. **Find a provider**: Query available providers:

```
structsd query structs provider-all
```

Or check your guild's providers. Look for one with acceptable `rateAmount`, `capacityMaximum`, and `durationMaximum`.

2. **Open an agreement** (CLI prompts — review rate × duration × capacity for the total upfront cost before accepting):

```
structsd tx structs agreement-open [provider-id] [duration-in-blocks] [capacity] --from [key-name] --gas auto --gas-adjustment 1.5
```

The agreement automatically creates an allocation.

3. **Connect the allocation to a substation**:

```
structsd tx structs substation-allocation-connect [substation-id] [allocation-id] --from [key-name] --gas auto --gas-adjustment 1.5
```

Connect to your guild's substation to benefit the guild, or create your own substation for independent energy management.

4. **Verify**: Query player to confirm capacity increased.

### Agreement Management

- Increase capacity: `agreement-capacity-increase [agreement-id] [additional-capacity]`
- Decrease capacity: `agreement-capacity-decrease [agreement-id] [reduce-by]`
- Extend duration: `agreement-duration-increase [agreement-id] [additional-blocks]`
- Close: `agreement-close [agreement-id]` — may incur cancellation penalty

## Sell Energy (Energy Commerce Pipeline)

If you have surplus capacity, you can sell energy to other players through the reactor-allocation-substation-provider pipeline. This is the core of Structs economic gameplay.

### Full Pipeline (Step by Step)

1. **Accumulate Alpha** -- Mine ore, refine immediately. Consolidate ualpha to the account that will manage energy commerce.

2. **Infuse into reactor** -- Increases your player capacity. Use your guild's reactor for simplicity:

```
structsd tx structs reactor-infuse [your-address] [validator-address] [amount]ualpha --from [key-name] --gas auto
```

The `validator-address` is `structsvaloper1...` (find it in `structsd query structs reactor [id]` under the `validator` field). Commission is locked at infusion time and permanent for that infusion.

3. **Create automated allocation** -- Routes your capacity to a substation. Use `automated` type so it auto-grows when you infuse more alpha:

```
structsd tx structs allocation-create --allocation-type automated --from [key-name] --gas auto -- [your-player-id] [power-amount]
```

4. **Create substation** -- The distribution node for your energy:

```
structsd tx structs substation-create --from [key-name] --gas auto -- [your-player-id] [allocation-id]
```

5. **Create provider** -- Your marketplace storefront:

```
structsd tx structs provider-create --from [key-name] --gas auto -- [substation-id] [rate] [access-policy] [provider-penalty] [consumer-penalty] [cap-min] [cap-max] [dur-min] [dur-max]
```

| Parameter | Purpose | Recommendation |
|-----------|---------|----------------|
| `rate` | Price per unit capacity per block | `1uguild.0-1` (guild tokens create demand for your guild's currency) |
| `access-policy` | Who can buy | `open-market` for maximum revenue |
| `provider-penalty` | Penalty you pay if you cancel | `0` initially |
| `consumer-penalty` | Penalty buyer pays if they cancel | `0` to lower friction |
| `cap-min` / `cap-max` | Capacity range per agreement | `1000` to `1000000000` |
| `dur-min` / `dur-max` | Duration range in blocks | `100` to `1000000` |

6. **Monitor agreements** -- Buyers open agreements against your provider:

```
structsd query structs provider [provider-id]
```

7. **Withdraw earnings periodically**:

```
structsd tx structs provider-withdraw-balance --from [key-name] --gas auto -- [provider-id]
```

### How Agreements Work (Payment Flow)

When a buyer opens an agreement:
1. Buyer pays `capacity * rate * duration` upfront in the rate denomination
2. Payment goes into the provider's **collateral address** (escrow)
3. System auto-creates a `provider-agreement` allocation (energy flows immediately)
4. Revenue **drips** from collateral to the provider's **earnings address** as blocks pass
5. Provider withdraws accumulated earnings at any time
6. On expiry (endBlock reached), the allocation is released

Agreement lifecycle: **OPEN -> ACTIVE -> EXPIRED** (or **CLOSED** early with cancellation penalties).

### The Energy Flywheel

The most powerful economic strategy in Structs is compounding energy:

1. Mine ore from planets
2. Refine ore into Alpha immediately
3. Infuse Alpha into the guild reactor
4. Automated allocation grows substation capacity
5. Sell energy via provider, earning guild tokens
6. Reinvest guild tokens (via `guild-bank-redeem` for alpha, or trade)

Each cycle compounds: more alpha = more capacity = more energy to sell = more tokens = more economic power.

### Important Notes

- **Defusion cooldown**: Infused alpha is not immediately liquid. `reactor-defuse` starts a cooldown period. Don't infuse alpha you may need for short-term operations (fleet rebuilds, emergency purchases).
- **Commission is locked**: The reactor's commission rate at infusion time is permanent for that specific infusion. Check commission before infusing.
- **Automated allocations**: Limited to **one per source**. They auto-grow with your capacity -- no manual adjustment needed after creation. If you attempt to create a second automated allocation from the same source, the transaction will error. Delete the existing one first, or use `dynamic` type for additional allocations.
- **Provider-agreement allocations**: Auto-created by the system when agreements open. Do not create or modify these manually.

### Provider Management

- Grant guild members access (for `guild-market` providers): `permission-guild-rank-set [provider-id] [guild-id] 262144 [rank]` (PermProviderOpen -- guild members at or above the specified rank can open agreements)
- Revoke guild access: `permission-guild-rank-revoke [provider-id] [guild-id] 262144`
- Update terms: `provider-update-capacity-maximum`, `provider-update-duration-minimum`, etc.
- Delete provider: `provider-delete [provider-id]` (close agreements first)

## Commands Reference

| Action | Command |
|--------|---------|
| Reactor infuse | `structsd tx structs reactor-infuse [your-addr] [validator-addr] [amount-ualpha]` (validator = `structsvaloper1...`, NOT reactor ID) |
| Reactor defuse | `structsd tx structs reactor-defuse [reactor-id]` |
| Reactor migrate | `structsd tx structs reactor-begin-migration [player-addr] [src-validator-addr] [dest-validator-addr] [amount]` |

| Open agreement | `structsd tx structs agreement-open [provider-id] [duration] [capacity]` |
| Close agreement | `structsd tx structs agreement-close [agreement-id]` |
| Create provider | `structsd tx structs provider-create [substation-id] [rate] [access] [prov-pen] [cons-pen] [cap-min] [cap-max] [dur-min] [dur-max]` |
| Delete provider | `structsd tx structs provider-delete [provider-id]` |
| Withdraw earnings | `structsd tx structs provider-withdraw-balance [provider-id]` |
| Connect allocation | `structsd tx structs substation-allocation-connect [substation-id] [allocation-id]` |
| Query player power | `structsd query structs player [id]` |
| Query reactor | `structsd query structs reactor [id]` |
| Query providers | `structsd query structs provider-all` |

**TX_FLAGS** (interactive — the CLI prompts you to confirm): `--from [key-name] --gas auto --gas-adjustment 1.5`

**TX_FLAGS_APPROVED** (only after commander approval; suppresses the prompt): TX_FLAGS plus `-y`. See [SAFETY.md](https://structs.ai/SAFETY) "The `-y` Rule." `reactor-infuse` and `struct-generator-infuse` are Tier 1/Tier 2 — always default to interactive so you see the validator, commission, amount, and (for generators) the irreversibility warning.

**Requires**: [`structsd`](https://structs.ai/skills/structsd-install/SKILL) on PATH and a configured signing key.

**Important**: Entity IDs containing dashes (like `3-1`, `4-5`) are misinterpreted as flags by the CLI parser. Always place `--` between flags and positional args: `structsd tx structs command --from key --gas auto -- [entity-id] [other-args]`

## Error Handling

- **Going offline** — Load exceeds capacity. Immediately deactivate non-essential structs (`struct-deactivate`), then increase capacity via reactor infusion or agreement.
- **"insufficient balance"** — Not enough ualpha. Mine and refine ore first, or buy energy via agreement instead.
- **"generator infuse failed"** — Verify the struct is a generator type (20, 21, or 22) and is online.
- **Commission too high** — Check other reactors. You can infuse into any reactor, not just your guild's.
- **No providers available** — Ask guild members to create providers, or infuse your own reactor.
