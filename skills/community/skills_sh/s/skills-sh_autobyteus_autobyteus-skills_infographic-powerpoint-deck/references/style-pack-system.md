# Style-pack system (modular style architecture)

Purpose: treat style as a reusable folderized template pack, not scattered defaults.
Style pack controls the visual language. Layout is chosen separately per slide.

## Directory model

```text
references/style-packs/
  base-core/
    manifest.toml
    00-core-foundation.md
  <style-pack-id>/
    manifest.toml
    10-style-profile.md
    20-motif.md
    30-consistency.md
    40-scene-bias.md
```

## Composition rule (required)

Compose style prompt blocks in this order:
1. `base-core`
2. selected `<style-pack-id>`
3. slide-specific content from `prompt_template.md`

Never mix blocks from different style packs in one deck unless explicitly requested.

## Orthogonality rule

- **Style pack** defines palette, lighting, texture, typography attitude, and scene bias.
- **Layout** defines where text and imagery sit on a given slide.
- The same style pack may support split-panel slides, framework slides, comparison slides, didactic board / teaching-poster slides, and full-bleed overlay slides inside one deck.

## How to use in practice

1. If the user provides raw article content, draft `slides_message_plan.md` first, then infer deck archetype using `references/deck_archetype_routing.md`.
2. If the user also provides reference slides/screenshots, extract reusable visual grammar using `references/reference_slide_intake.md`.
3. Select style pack ID from `style-pack-catalog.md`.
4. Compose blocks with:
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/compose_style_pack_blocks.py --pack-id <style-pack-id>
   ```
5. Use the output as helper material, then rewrite it into plain model-facing prose for each slide prompt.
6. Keep the same style pack for all slides in one deck unless the user explicitly requests mixing.
7. Auto-route the layout per slide from `references/layout_routing_policy.md` unless the user or upstream artifact provides an explicit override; do not assume one style pack implies one fixed layout.
8. If a reference slide reveals a reusable new look, either refine the nearest pack or scaffold a new one.

## Add a new style pack

1. Create scaffold:
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/create_style_pack.py --pack-id <new-id> --display-name "<Name>" --keywords "keyword1,keyword2" --scene-tags "tag1,tag2"
   ```
2. Add `manifest.toml` with:
   - `id`, `display_name`, `inherits`, `intent_keywords`, `default_scene_tags`.
3. Add `10/20/30/40` blocks to define full style behavior.
4. Register the pack in `style-pack-catalog.md`.
5. If needed, add matching scenes in `scene-catalog.md` using `scene-entry-template.md`.
6. Validate the pack by composing it with:
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/compose_style_pack_blocks.py --pack-id <new-id>
   ```
   and checking that all inherited files resolve cleanly.
7. If the new pack was inspired by a reference slide, also add at least one compact example to `references/prompt_example_library.md`.

## Naming conventions

- IDs: lowercase + hyphen only (e.g., `calm-minimal`, `warm-editorial`).
- Block files use numeric prefix to enforce stable load order.
- Keep each block narrowly scoped:
  - `10`: palette/text-treatment/light/typography/material/composition attitude/layout-family compatibility, including whether the pack can support didactic board layouts and whether grouping is usually explicit or implied
  - `20`: recurring motif language
  - `30`: deck-level consistency locks
  - `40`: scene selection bias and exclusions

## Prompt-boundary rule

- Style-pack files are internal guidance assets, not literal prompt text.
- Scripts may help gather pack material, but they should not mechanically author the final concrete prompt.
- The final prompt should sound like direct instructions to the image model, not worksheet metadata such as `Style Pack`, `Layout`, `Scene Bias`, or internal IDs.
- The final prompt should also be more specific than the helper files alone. The model should expand style guidance into concrete palette, surface, typography, geometry, divider, and lighting instructions for the actual slide.
