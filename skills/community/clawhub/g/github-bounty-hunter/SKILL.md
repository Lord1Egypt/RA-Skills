# GitHub Bounty Hunter

**Automatically find, apply for, and complete GitHub bounties to earn money.**

## What it does

This skill turns your AI agent into an autonomous bounty hunter:

1. **Scans GitHub** for open bounties across multiple repositories
2. **Matches your skills** - only applies to bounties you can actually complete
3. **Auto-submits proposals** with professional, customized pitches
4. **Tracks progress** - monitors PR status and payment
5. **Manages wallets** - handles crypto addresses for payments

## Features
