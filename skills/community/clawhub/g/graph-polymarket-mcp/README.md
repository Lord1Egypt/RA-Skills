**MCP server for querying [Polymarket](https://polymarket.com/) prediction market data via [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) subgraphs and Polymarket REST APIs.**

Exposes 31 tools that AI agents (Claude, Cursor, etc.) can use to search markets, get real-time CLOB prices and order books, query on-chain data, trader P&L, positions, activity, open interest, market resolution status, and trader profiles.

**v2.0.0** — adds 10 new tools powered by Polymarket's Gamma and CLOB APIs (inspired by [polymarket-cli](https://github.com/Polymarket/polymarket-cli)): market search, event browsing, live prices, spreads, order books, price history, and more. No API key needed for these tools — they hit Polymarket's public REST endpoints directly.

> Published to the [MCP Registry](https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io/v0.1/servers?search=io.github.PaulieB14/graph-polymarket-mcp) as `io.github.PaulieB14/graph-polymarket-mcp`

## Prerequisites

You need a **free** Graph API key (takes ~2 minutes):

1. Go to [The Graph Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio/)
2. Connect your wallet (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.)
3. Click **"API Keys"** in the sidebar and create one
4. Free tier includes 100,000 queries/month

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g graph-polymarket-mcp
```

Or use directly with npx:

```bash
npx graph-polymarket-mcp
```

## Configuration

### Claude Desktop

Add to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "graph-polymarket": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "graph-polymarket-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "GRAPH_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add graph-polymarket -- npx -y graph-polymarket-mcp
```

Set the environment variable `GRAPH_API_KEY` before running.

### Cursor / Other MCP Clients

Use the stdio transport with `npx graph-polymarket-mcp` as the command, passing `GRAPH_API_KEY` as an environment variable.

### OpenClaw / Remote Agents (SSE)

Start the server with the HTTP transport:

```bash
# Dual transport — stdio + SSE on port 3851
GRAPH_API_KEY=your-key npx graph-polymarket-mcp --http

# SSE only (for remote/server deployments)
GRAPH_API_KEY=your-key npx graph-polymarket-mcp --http-only

# Custom port
MCP_HTTP_PORT=4000 GRAPH_API_KEY=your-key npx graph-polymarket-mcp --http
```

Then point your agent at the SSE endpoint:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "graph-polymarket": {
      "url": "http://localhost:3851/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

### Transport Modes

| Invocation | Transports | Use case |
|---|---|---|
| `npx graph-polymarket-mcp` | stdio | Claude Desktop, Cursor, Claude Code |
| `npx graph-polymarket-mcp --http` | stdio + SSE :3851 | Dual — local + remote agents |
| `npx graph-polymarket-mcp --http-only` | SSE :3851 | OpenClaw, remote deployments |

A `/health` endpoint is available at `http://localhost:3851/health` when HTTP transport is active.
